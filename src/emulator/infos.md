6052 processor, 8 bits microprocessor, runs at 1.79 MHz
256-byte Stack, with no overflow protection
151 valid opcodes, 105 invalid

#Memory
16-Byte address space => 0x0000 -> 0xFFFF (64KB Total)
Nes had only 2KB of RAM, from 0x0000 -> 0x0800

The rest of the adresses : 0x0801 -> 0xFFFF are used to access the PPU, the APU, the inputs, the Game Cartridge
